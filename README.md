## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM methodology
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I've learned that making a layout plan for mobile and desktop before coding HTML helps üòÅ. In previous projects I didn't do this and got me into trouble later on.

In this project I implemented lessons learned...

_This CSS code centers the span in price element_

```css
.subscription__price {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 1.8rem;
  font-weight: 700;
  line-height: 1;
}
.subscription__price span {
  font-size: 0.7em;
  font-weight: 400;
  opacity: 0.5;
  padding-left: 0.8rem;
}
```

### Continued development

This was a fun project, not as difficult as previous projects. But stil a lot of things to learn.

It is an eyopener to experience that 'coding in the wild' is something different than following a course.

Basic knowledge about HTML, CSS and JavaScript is nice to have. When I work through the projects a read extra information about some parts of the challenge. Try to extend my skills in coding.

So I'm moving forward to a new project and hope to learn new things, again.
